  <LongDescription># 2LS California Highway (Freeway) Signs for Cities: Skylines II

Hello Cities: Skylines II civil engineers! This is a **Write Everywhere Module** that brings 2 lane small California highway (freeway) signs into Cities: Skylines II!

## Features

- 2 Lane (Small) California Highway (Freeway) signs inspired by California's MUTCD
- 71 total signs (see screenshots)
- Additional 85 new signs with exit tab style 1 with Ext1 WE atlas pack (with v1.1 update)
- WE Layout included for easy implementation onto your highways (freeways)

## How to Use

1. Install the **Requirements** needed for this mod (Write Everywhere).
2. Place a matching road structure in-game.
3. Open **Write Everywhere** Selector (Default: CTRL + Shift + W).
4. Click on the structure you wanna edit.
5. Click on the Folder Icon (Import/load...).
6. Click on Import layout from xml at root.
7. Click on the puzzle-piece (Templates from mods)... (see screenshot)
8. Click on 2LS CA Highway Signs (WE). (see screenshot)
9. Click on 2LS CA Highway Sign.wedefault.xml. (see screenshot)
10. The layout will be added to WE's COMPONENTS TREE window. (see screenshot)
11. Click the down arrow on 2LS CA Highway Sign.
12. Select Sign Image.
13. On the CONTENT window, set Atlas to 2LS CA Highway Signs (WE):2LS CA Highway Signs. (see screenshot)
14. Set Image and customize it to your city needs! (there are plenty of WE Modules on Paradox Mods that include highway shields for use with 2LS CA Highway (Freeway) Signs)

There is some terminology that you can use to determine what sign is what:

- 2LS - 2 Lane Small
- Blank - Blank Sign
- YB - Yellow Banner
- EO - Exit Only
- D - Down Arrow
- R - Right Arrow
- L - Left Arrow
- O - Only
- RF1 - Retro-fit Style 1 (Yellow stickers usually with white arrows)
- RF2 - Retro-fit Style 2 (Yellow stickers usually with black arrows)
- RL - Right Long Arrow
- LL - Left Long Arrow
- RTLNE - Right Lane
- LTLNE - Left Lane
- ExtR - Exit Tab Right
- ExtL - Exit Tab Left
- ExtR2 - Exit Tab Right Style 2
- ExtL2 - Exit Tab Left Style 2

### Customize and Save Signs

- Select the root object → **Save &amp; Export as XML**
- Templates can be reused in the same city or other saves.
- All templates are stored locally.
- These don't need the step "Templates from mods"

## Requirements

- [Write Everywhere](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/92908/Windows) – required

### Fonts

No fonts included. Any True-Type font (.ttf) can be used with these signs. I personally use Google's Overpass Medium font!

### How to install fonts

1. Download the True-Type font (.ttf) that you want from the Internet.
2. Go to your local Cities: Skylines II mods folder where Write Everywhere is located:
3. %userprofile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Colossal Order\\Cities Skylines II\\ModsData\\.Klyte45Mods\\WriteEverywhere\\fonts (if the fonts folder does not exist, create it manually)
4. Place the True-Type font (.ttf) files inside the folder.
5. Start Cities: Skylines II and load your city.
6. Press the W Icon (Write Everywhere Icon) on the Top Left of your screen. Go to **City Fonts**.
7. Press the **+** button and choose the True-Type font (.ttf).
